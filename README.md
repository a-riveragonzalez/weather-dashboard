# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard that allows users to search for a city and get it's current weather and a five day forcast. The current weather holds the name of the city, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index. If the UV index is favorable, it will appear green; if it is moderate, it will appear yellow; if it is severe, then it will appear red. The user's recent citites will also be displayed and able to click on for the forcast.
This project uses OpenWeather API, bootstrap, jquery, moment js, google fonts, javascript, css, and html.
